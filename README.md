### Hi there 👋 I'm Yam Rodriguez




# 💫 About Me:

As a data enthusiast with a background in statistical analysis & backend development, I have a strong foundation in designing and building systems that efficiently handle large volumes of data and traffic. 

I'm also passionate about data science and engineering, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge in these fields. I have experience in database management, RESTful API design, and cloud technologies such as AWS, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills in data analytics, machine learning, and data visualization.

I believe that lifelong learning is key to success in any field, which is why I'm always seeking ways to expand my skills and knowledge. I love sharing my knowledge with others through mentoring and community outreach programs.
